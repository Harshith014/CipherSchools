Features
User Authentication: Secure login and registration using JWT, with passwords hashed by bcryptjs.
Proctoring: After login, the platform requests camera and microphone permissions for proctoring during the test.
MCQ Test Interface: A user-friendly interface built with shadcn UI. The test includes a timer, a camera preview interface, and options to navigate freely between 10 MCQs. Users can save answers as they select options.
Admin Panel: Role-based authorization allows administrators to create test questions and manage test rooms.
Email Notifications: Using node-cron and Nodemailer, the system evaluates tests and sends users their scores via email.
State Management: Context API is used for managing user state throughout the application.
Role-Based Authorization: Secure role-based access to specific features and functionalities (e.g., admin panel).
Cron Jobs: node-cron is used to schedule evaluation tasks every hour and send test results via email using Nodemailer with Pug templates.

Usage
User Registration and Login: Upon registration, users can log in and access the MCQ tests. The login status is maintained via JWT stored in context API, which conditionally renders the login, register, and logout buttons.

Taking the Test: After successful authentication, users can grant permission for their camera and microphone to start the test. The MCQ interface includes a camera preview and a timer. Users can freely navigate between the 10 MCQs and save their answers.

Submitting the Test: After submitting the test, users are redirected to a completion page with a message indicating the test is completed. Test results are evaluated using a cron job that runs every hour, and results are sent via email.

Admin Panel
Administrators can access the admin panel to create new MCQ tests and manage test rooms. Role-based access control ensures only users with admin privileges can perform these actions.

Email Service
Results are automatically evaluated and sent to users via email using Nodemailer.
Emails are sent based on the cron job that runs every hour, triggered 5 minutes after test completion.
The email template is rendered using Pug, ensuring a clean and professional format.
Testing
